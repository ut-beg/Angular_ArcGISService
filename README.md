This is a service for use with the Angular Javascript MVC framework.  It provides an abstraction layer for the ArcGIS REST API within an Angular application.  

The javascript file, along with a minified version and its single dependency, LocalStorageService, are located in the ./ArcGISService/js/ directory.



The repo also includes a simple Angular application that demonstrates the more basic functions of the library, such as fetching the service metadata and performing queries.

API documentation will be forthcoming as time permits.
